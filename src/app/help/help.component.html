      <h5 class="text-muted">Requesting a RespiteSource Account</h5>
      <p>
        To join RespiteSource, you'll need to request an account and have your membership be approved by Foster Source
        staff and your case worker.
      </p>
      <p>
        After reading through this help page in full, you may visit <a href="/login/create-account">this link</a> to
        apply for an account.
      </p>
      <h5 class="text-muted">Eligibility</h5>
      <p>
        Not everyone is eligible for a RespiteSource account. If you are ineligible, your account will not be approved,
        and repeated requests to apply for RespiteSource will lead to you being permanently blacklisted (meaning that
        even if you are eligible in the future as the site grows, you will be unable to apply).
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >If you answer "yes" to any of the following questions, you are currently considered ineligible for a
          RespiteSource account.</b
        >
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you live outside of Colorado, USA?</li>
        <li>[Add more questions!]</li>
      </ul>
      <h5 class="text-muted">The Approval Process</h5>
      <p>
        When you submit the form to request your account, you'll first need to verify your email to continue in the
        process. Your account cannot be reviewed (and therefore cannot be approved) until you've provided and verified a
        valid email address.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you verify your account, you'll need to sit tight while the Foster Source staff verifies your account so
        that we can ensure a safe (and legal) environment for finding and providing respite care. This process involves
        [... What does it involve?]
      </p>
      <p>
        When your account has been approved, you will receive an email notifying you that you can now log in and
        complete your profile. If your account is denied, you will be notified and (depending on the reasons for your
        account being denied) you will be able to reapply in the future.
      </p>
      <h5 class="text-muted">Completing Your Account</h5>
      <p>
        Once you have verified your account and it has been approved (again, you will be notified via email when your
        account has been approved), you can log in and complete your account. You will not be able to use the majority
        of the features of the site until you complete your profile.
      </p>
      <p><b>Some important things to note:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Only your preferred name will be shown publicly, so for example if your name is "John Smith", you can set your
          preferred name to "John S.", "J. Smith", or even just "John"
        </li>
        <li>
          You need to provide a profile picture to complete your account. Please ensure it is of your face, or if you
          are sharing an account, of both of you.
        </li>
        <li>
          You have the option to add a "Secondary Account Holder". A secondary account holder is just someone you share
          an account with, such as your spouse. You will share a login, but both of your preferred names and provided
          contact information will be available.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you mark yourself as being unable to provide respite care you will not show up in the respite search, and
          vice versa. You can change this in the future if you decide to start offering child care.
        </li>
        <li>
          While not all fields are required, the more fields you fill out, the more specifically parents in need can
          search for you. This means that they can find child care faster and you will receive less messages about
          children that you are unable to provide care for.
        </li>
        <li>
          Note that while you are setting your general availability to provide child care here, you can
          <a href="/user/update/primary-availability">change it</a> in the future. Additionally, after completing your
          account you can <a href="/user/update/temporary-availability">set temporary availabilities</a>, such as if you
          were going on vacation for a couple weeks or had a temporary change in schedule.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="provide-respite" class="text-primary">Providing Respite Care</h3>
      <h5 class="text-muted">Marking Your Account As Able To Provide Respite</h5>
      <p>
        Your account will only show up in the respite search results if you have indicated that you are able to provide
        respite care. While you can do this in the process of creating your profile, you can also do it later on if you
        decide that you'd like to provide respite care by visiting
        <a href="/user/create/respite-provider-info">this link</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will be asked to provide some various information about your ability to provide care, all of which can be
        updated in the future as your answers change. To update your respite provider info,
        <a href="/user/update/respite-provider-info">visit this link</a>.
      </p>
      <h5 class="text-muted">Primary Availability</h5>
      <p>
        Your primary availability is your baseline availability, as indicated when you completed your account (or if you
        later indicated that you were able to provide respite care). Parents in search of respite care will use these
        times as guidelines for when you may be able to provide care, and as such, you may receive child care requests
        for during these times.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your general availability changes, you should update it as soon as possible
        <a href="/user/update/primary-availability">here</a>.
      </p>
      <h5 class="text-muted">Temporary Availability</h5>
      <p>
        If you have a temporary change in schedule, you can set temporary availabilities. When you have indicated that
        you'd like to use a temporary availability, other users will be unable to see your general primary schedule.
      </p>
      <p>
        A temporary availability can be created and set to expire on a certain day. For example, if you are leaving for
        vacation for two weeks, you can create a temporary availability with no free times that expires in two weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can create, remove, and view your temporary availabilities
        <a href="/user/update/temporary-availability">here</a>.
      </p>
      <h5 class="text-muted">Response Etiquette</h5>
      <p>
        When you have indicated that you are able to provide respite, foster parents in need of respite care may contact
        you using your provided information. To keep things as civil and smooth as possible, we provide these
        suggestions for responding to these requests:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>How are parents expected to respond? TODO</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="col-12 col-md-6 px-5 text-justify mt-5">
      <h3 id="respite-search" class="text-primary">Searching for Respite</h3>
      <h5 class="text-muted">The Respite Database</h5>
      <p>
        The respite database is what you search when you use the respite search functionality. While all users' profiles
        are public, only those who have indicated that they are able to provide respite show up here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Results are sorted by distance, and these distances are based on your provided address (which is not publicly
        visible). They are <b>NOT</b> based on your current location.
      </p>
      <h5 class="text-muted">Filtering</h5>
      <p>
        The feature you will likely find most useful is the ability to filter the results that you are seeing. Click the
        purple "Filter" button to open the filter panel and choose between options such as max distance, how many
        children you need to be cared for, specific days, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that filters are additive, so putting too many filters will likely give you no results. For best results,
        choose a few options that are most important to you to filter by.
      </p>
      <h5 class="text-muted">Resetting Your Filters</h5>
      <p>
        These filters are saved in your browser for future searches. If you have filters applied, they will be displayed
        as small boxes under the search bar.
      </p>
      <p>If you need to reset your search, you can click the purple "clear filters" button.</p>
      <h5 class="text-muted">Searching</h5>
      <p>
        There is also a search bar available. This will be useful if you are looking for a specific name or keywords.
        The search bar searches only users' preferred names, their biographies, and the city that they have indicated
        that they are able to provide respite in.
